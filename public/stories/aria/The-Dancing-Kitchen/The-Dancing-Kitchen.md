# The Dancing Kitchen

Once upon a time, in a castle made entirely of marshmallows and chocolate (which was quite messy on hot days), there lived a princess named Poppy who had a very silly problem – all of her food liked to dance!

Yes, you heard that right! Every morning when Poppy went down to breakfast, her pancakes would twirl across the plate, her eggs would do the cha-cha, and her orange juice would splash about doing the wave. The royal chef, a very serious man named Chef Grumblekins, was at his wit's end.

"Your Highness!" he would shout, chasing after a tap-dancing toast. "Please tell your breakfast to behave!"

But Poppy would just giggle, watching her breakfast having so much fun. The bacon did the twist, the butter slid around doing the moonwalk, and even the syrup jumped up and down doing the boogie-woogie.

## The Grand Duke's Visit

One day, a very important guest came to visit – the Grand Duke of Vegetableton. He was known throughout the land for being the most serious person ever. He had never laughed, not even once! Chef Grumblekins was terrified.

"Oh dear, oh dear," he muttered, stirring his pots frantically. "We must make sure nothing dances during the Grand Duke's visit!"

But as soon as the food was served, the carrots started doing cartwheels, the peas began playing leap-frog, and the mashed potatoes formed themselves into a conga line!

The Grand Duke's eyes grew wider and wider. His mouth started to twitch. And then...

"HAHAHAHAHAHA!" He burst out laughing so hard that his monocle flew right off his nose! "This is the most wonderful dinner I've ever had!" he declared, watching a bunch of broccoli do the Russian ballet.

## The Dancing Castle

From that day on, the castle became famous for its dancing dinners. People came from far and wide to watch the musical meatballs and the salsa-dancing salad. Chef Grumblekins even started teaching his soups to swing dance!

And every evening, Princess Poppy would host the grandest food-dancing party in all the land. The tables would be full of waltzing watermelons, break-dancing bread rolls, and pirouetting pizzas. Even the pickles, who were usually quite sour, would join in with a jolly polka.

As for the castle itself? Well, the marshmallow walls and chocolate towers would sway gently to the music, making sure not to melt too much in all the excitement.

And that's how Princess Poppy's peculiar problem turned into the kingdom's most cherished celebration. Because sometimes the silliest things in life turn out to be the most wonderful of all.

_The very, very wiggly end!_

_(But wait... is that your dinner starting to dance too?)_
