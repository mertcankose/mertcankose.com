# The Giggling Cloud

High up in the morning sky lived a fluffy little cloud named Bubbles. Bubbles had a very silly problem – she couldn't stop giggling! Every morning when the sun peeked out to say hello, Bubbles would burst into giggles that sounded like tiny silver bells.

"Tee-hee-hee!" she would laugh, bouncing up and down in the sky.

The sun, a big friendly fellow named Mr. Sunshine, found this quite amusing. "Good morning, little Bubbles!" he'd say with a warm smile.

"Good _giggle_ morning _giggle_ Mr. Sunshine!" Bubbles would reply, rolling around with laughter.

The other clouds didn't quite know what to make of Bubbles. There was Mrs. Grumpy Gray Cloud, who liked to be serious and make rain. And Mr. Puffy White Cloud, who spent all day trying to make shapes like elephants and boats.

One morning, Mrs. Grumpy Gray Cloud floated over to Bubbles. "Young cloud," she said in her rainiest voice, "clouds are supposed to be dignified!"

But just then, a playful breeze tickled Bubbles, making her giggle even harder. "Hee-hee-hee-hee!"

Her giggles were so contagious that even Mrs. Grumpy Gray Cloud's frown started to twitch. Soon, she was chuckling too! Her rain drops turned into sparkly sprinkles that made rainbows everywhere.

Mr. Puffy White Cloud couldn't help joining in. As he laughed, he turned into all sorts of funny shapes – a dancing hippo, a silly monkey, and even a cloud wearing a big silly hat!

By lunchtime, the whole sky was filled with laughing clouds. Mr. Sunshine beamed brighter than ever, spreading golden light through all the giggles.

Down below, children pointed up at the sky in wonder. "Look!" they shouted. "The clouds are having a party!"

And from that day on, every morning became a celebration in the sky. Even on rainy days, you could hear the happy sounds of Bubbles and her cloud friends, sharing giggles and making the whole world a little bit brighter.

And if you listen carefully on a sunny morning, you might just hear a tiny "tee-hee-hee" floating down from above!

The End (with a giggle!)
