# The Bravest Little Night Light

In a cozy bedroom on Maple Street lived a little night light named Sparkle. She had a round, glowing face and a warm, golden smile. But Sparkle had a funny secret – she was afraid of the dark!

"But you're a night light!" her friend Lamp would say from the desk nearby. "Your whole job is to shine in the dark!"

"I know," Sparkle would reply with a nervous flicker. "But what if my bulb goes out? What if I can't shine bright enough? What if the dark is too big?"

Every evening when the sun went down, Sparkle would tremble a tiny bit. But she never forgot her important job – keeping her friend Emma, the little girl who lived in the room, feeling safe and cozy at bedtime.

One evening, as clouds covered the moon, something wonderful happened. Emma noticed Sparkle's nervous flickering and sat up in bed.

"Are you scared of the dark too?" she asked softly.

Sparkle's light brightened in surprise – Emma could tell how she was feeling!

"You know what my mommy told me?" Emma continued, hugging her teddy bear. "The dark is just the world playing peek-a-boo. Everything is still there, just waiting to say hello again!"

This made Sparkle think. She'd never considered that before.

"And you know what else?" Emma whispered. "When it's dark, that's when stars can sparkle their brightest. Just like you!"

Suddenly, Sparkle didn't feel so scared anymore. She realized that she wasn't alone in the dark – she had Emma, Lamp, the stars outside the window, and even the friendly darkness itself.

From that night on, Sparkle saw the dark differently. Instead of a big empty space, it was like a cozy blanket that helped everyone rest. She even made friends with Shadow, the playful darkness under Emma's bed who liked to make funny shapes on the wall.

Every night, Sparkle would glow a little brighter, not because she was scared, but because she was happy to be sharing the peaceful darkness with all her friends. She discovered that being brave didn't mean never being scared – it meant shining your light even when you are.

And sometimes, on special nights, Emma would whisper to Sparkle before falling asleep, "Thank you for being brave with me."

Sparkle would glow with pride, knowing that she and Emma were helping each other be just a little bit braver every day.

The End (with a warm, gentle glow!)
