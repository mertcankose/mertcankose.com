# The Home Run Hero

Tommy "Tiny" Thompson was the smallest player on the Riverdale Rockets Little League team. While other kids could hit the ball clear across the field, Tommy's hits usually bounced right back to the pitcher. But Tommy had two special things: the biggest smile in baseball and a very unusual lucky charm – his grandmother's old baseball cards.

"Remember, Tommy," his grandma would say, showing him her precious collection, "the greatest players weren't always the biggest or strongest. They were the ones who never gave up!"

Every night, Tommy would study those cards, learning about legends like Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson. He especially loved the card of Yogi Berra, who wasn't very tall either but became one of baseball's greatest catchers.

At practice, while other kids tried to hit home runs, Tommy worked on his bunting. While they threw fastballs, he practiced catching every type of pitch. He might have been small, but he became the best at knowing exactly where to stand in the field.

One day, during the championship game against the mighty Millbrook Giants, something amazing happened. The Rockets were down by one run in the last inning, with two outs and a runner on third base. And guess who was up to bat?

"Oh no," groaned some parents in the stands. "It's Tiny Tommy."

But Tommy remembered what he'd learned from those old baseball cards. He choked up on the bat, just like his grandma had shown him in pictures of Willie Keeler, another small player who became a legend.

The Giants' pitcher threw the ball as hard as he could. Tommy didn't try to swing for the fences. Instead, he did what he'd practiced thousands of times – he laid down the perfect bunt.

The ball rolled slowly down the third base line. The Giants' players weren't ready – they'd been standing way back, expecting a tiny hit they could easily catch. By the time the pitcher reached the ball, Tommy was safely on first base, and his teammate had scored from third!

The game was tied! But Tommy wasn't done. While everyone was still celebrating the perfect bunt, he remembered another lesson from his baseball cards – about stolen bases and surprise plays.

When no one was looking, Tommy took off running to second base. The surprise was so complete that by the time the Giants realized what was happening, Tommy was sliding into second!

The next batter hit a simple ground ball, but because Tommy was already on second, he was able to race home and score the winning run!

The Rockets had won the championship! Everyone cheered as Tommy's teammates lifted him onto their shoulders. "Tiny Tommy! Tiny Tommy!" they chanted.

That night, as Tommy's grandma tucked him into bed, she added a new card to her collection – a photo of Tommy scoring the winning run, with his huge smile lighting up his face.

"You see," she said, kissing his forehead, "champions come in all sizes. It's not about being the biggest or strongest..."

"It's about being the smartest and never giving up!" Tommy finished, hugging his new baseball card close.

And as he drifted off to sleep, Tommy dreamed of all the future games he would play, where being small didn't matter at all – because his heart was championship size.

The End (with a smile as big as a baseball diamond!)
